# The recital element #

The recital is a special structural part of the preamble in the France tradition (Belgium, France, Luxemburg, Canda, etc.) and also in the European Parliament/Commission tradition.

The `recital` is intended be a `tblock` and `recitals` a container of tblock. In the proposal of the EU Commission the recital is refered to like an article (e.g. http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2002:021E:0105:0105:EN:PDF, or "[7](7.md) However, the Commission notes that the text of recital 5 is not consistent with the provisions of Articles 1(2) and 7(2).
