#summary Guide used when adding a new schema-release in the website http://examples.akomantoso.org/schema-releases.html

= Introduction =

The Schema releases website is a PHP/XML website for showing the release notes and provide a diff feature on the schema-releases.


= Checkout from repository =

{{{
svn co https://akomantoso.googlecode.com/svn/examples_website/trunk examples_website
}}}

After the checkout, the directory structure should be similar to this:
{{{
examples_website/
├── alphabetical.html
├── categorical.html
├── schema-releases.html
├── usage.html
├── favicon.ico
├── css/
├── doc/
├── images/
├── loader/
├── release_notes/
├── php/
├── releases/
├── script/
├── tmp/
└── xslt/
}}}

In order add a new schema-release to the website, you only work with *doc/* and *releases/* directories

== releases.xml ==

*doc/releases.xml* is the file that contains a list of all the akoma ntoso releases.

Open *doc/releases.xml* file, it will have a this structure:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<releases>
    <release number="23">
        <title>Latest Release: May 2013</title>
        <notes>
           Release notes release notes...                    
        </notes>
    </release>     
    <release number="22">
        <title>Diff:May 2013 & Feb 2013</title>
        <notes>
           Release notes release notes...                    
        </notes>
    </release>     
    ...
</releases>
}}}

Duplicate the top-most *`<release/>`* node and increment the `number` value by one. Update the *`<title/>`* and *`<notes/>`* nodes appropriately and save the document.

== Adding a release schema ==

Copy the latest *akomantoso30.xsd* file you have downloaded into *releases/* directory

Rename it to *release-#.xsd"

*NB:* The number should be the same as the one used in *`<release number="#"/>`* in the prior step.

Finally checkin the changes and regenerate the website.
