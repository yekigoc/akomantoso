#summary Representing permissions in Akoma Ntoso documents

= Introduction =

Sometimes legislative documents come with a concept of Permissions associated with the users accessing the document.

e.g. - A bill still in a draft stage undergoing review between the clerk and a member of parliament. There could be a need to represent this "private" state as permissions within the document.

= Usage =

Permissions are NOT currently managed by Akoma Ntoso, and should best be placed in the proprietary or, better yet, in the `<preservation>` element within the `<FRBRManifestation>` element.
