#summary Differentiating between similarly named legislation using URI naming convention

= Introduction = 

Sometimes acts may have the same number and year, its also possible for different acts passed in two different legislatures in the same country (e.g. National and Provincial legislature) to have the same number and Year. How does Akoma Ntoso handle this ?

= Emanating Actors = 

This differentiation is done by using the emanating actor part of the URI :
{{{
"The emanating actor, unless implicitly deducible by the document type (e.g. acts and bills do not usually require actor, while ministerial decrees do)"
}}}

So the URIs could be differentiated as follows :

Judgement :

Legislation :
