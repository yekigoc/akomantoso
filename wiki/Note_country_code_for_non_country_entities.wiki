#summary Representing non-country entities in Akoma ntoso 

= Introduction =

The FRBRWork requires a country:

    "Country (a two-letter code according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)"

What do we use for documents produced by non-country entitities i.e. regional parliaments (east african legislative assembly) or pan african parliament ?

= Usage =

We need to distinguish authority to the country/territory.
 * East african legislative assembly is an authority
 * East African Community is a territory.

The ISO-Alpha-2 codification permits defining local codes for internal purposes:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2]

{{{
User-assigned code elements 

User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following alpha-2 codes can be user-assigned:
AA, QM to QZ, XA to XZ, and ZZ. For example:............
}}}

So the solutions are in two directions:
 # to consider the country where the authority is based ( east african legislative assembl has headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania)
 # to fix a list of codes for the territoriy, not only for Africa e.g. Comunidad Andina, in Akoma Ntoso, like the UN and the EU made, using the user-assigned codes.
