# Introduction #

The FRBRWork requires a country:

> "Country (a two-letter code according to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2)"

What do we use for documents produced by non-country entitities i.e. regional parliaments (east african legislative assembly) or pan african parliament ?

# Usage #

We need to distinguish authority to the country/territory.
  * East african legislative assembly is an authority
  * East African Community is a territory.

The ISO-Alpha-2 codification permits defining local codes for internal purposes:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-1\_alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)

```
User-assigned code elements 

User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following alpha-2 codes can be user-assigned:
AA, QM to QZ, XA to XZ, and ZZ. For example:............
```

So the solutions are in two directions:
  1. to consider the country where the authority is based ( east african legislative assembl has headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania)
  1. to fix a list of codes for the territoriy, not only for Africa e.g. Comunidad Andina, in Akoma Ntoso, like the UN and the EU made, using the user-assigned codes.
